/**
 * Caps how long any request may hang with no response.
 *
 * Without this, a request against a cold/recycling backend process that
 * stalls instead of erroring cleanly leaves its Observable never emitting
 * `next` OR `error` — any `loading`/`submitting` flag gated on that
 * subscription's callbacks then stays `true` forever, so the UI just spins
 * indefinitely. This is far more visible on mobile: backgrounding the tab
 * between visits is exactly the idle gap that lets a free/low-tier host
 * recycle its process, so the very next request is the one that hits a
 * cold start.
 *
 * A timed-out request rejects as a plain `HttpErrorResponse` (status 0) so
 * it flows through `errorInterceptor` exactly like a network failure —
 * every existing `error:` handler already deals with that.
 *
 * The login endpoint is exempt — it chains an FCM token fetch ahead of the
 * network call (see `AuthService.login`), so it can legitimately take
 * longer than a typical request; it relies on the browser's own connection
 * timeout instead.
